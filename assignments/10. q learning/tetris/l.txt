dqn.py ‚Äî The Neural Network (Model)

This file defines the architecture of the Deep Q-Network (DQN), a basic feed-forward neural network.

class DeepQNetwork(nn.Module):
    This is your neural network model used to approximate Q-values.

Architecture:
    Input: 4 features ‚Äî [lines_cleared, holes, bumpiness, height].
    Hidden layers:
    Layer 1: 64 neurons + ReLU
    Layer 2: 64 neurons + ReLU

Output layer:
    1 output (expected reward for a given action)

def forward(self, x):
    Performs a forward pass through the network.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
tetris.py ‚Äî The Environment Wrapper
This file contains the full environment logic for the Tetris game.

What it does:
    Manages game rules, pieces, collisions, line-clearing, scoring, rendering, and simulating gameplay steps.
    Converts game states into numerical features for your model.

Core methods:
    reset() ‚Äî Initializes or resets the board.
    get_state_properties(board) ‚Äî Returns 4 engineered features used as input to DQN.
    get_next_states() ‚Äî Simulates all possible actions and returns resulting states.
    step(action) ‚Äî Applies an action, updates the game state, and returns a reward and whether the game is over.
    render() ‚Äî Uses OpenCV to visualize the game in real time or save to video.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
üèãÔ∏è train.py ‚Äî Training Script
This is the heart of your training loop for the DQN.

Key responsibilities:
    Training loop: For a number of epochs, it:
    Chooses an action (exploration or exploitation via epsilon-greedy).
    Performs that action in the game.
    Saves experience (state, action, reward, next_state) to a replay buffer.
    Samples mini-batches from the buffer and updates the DQN model.

Special features:
    max_sc: Ends an epoch early if a score threshold is reached.
    save best model: Saves the model only if it outperforms the previous best.
    TensorBoard logs for visualization.
    Logging to file (training.log) for later analysis.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
üß™ test.py ‚Äî Testing Script
This script loads a saved model and runs it in the Tetris environment.

Workflow:
    Loads model checkpoint.
    Runs multiple test episodes (default = 3).
    Renders game with OpenCV and records a video (output.mp4).
    Logs individual and average scores and cleared lines.

üîÅ Integration Flow:
User plays ‚û° Generates State ‚û° DQN predicts action ‚û° Environment steps ‚û° Updates memory ‚û° Model trains ‚û° Repeats

dqn.py ‚Äî Deep Q-Network Architecture
This file defines the neural network used to estimate Q-values.
DeepQNetwork Class:
    A simple 3-layer feedforward neural network:
        self.conv1 = nn.Sequential(nn.Linear(4, 64), nn.ReLU(inplace=True))
        self.conv2 = nn.Sequential(nn.Linear(64, 64), nn.ReLU(inplace=True))
        self.conv3 = nn.Sequential(nn.Linear(64, 1))
    Input size: 4 (lines cleared, holes, bumpiness, height)
    Output size: 1 (Q-value of the given state)

    Purpose: Learn how good a state is (not action-specific here; actions are inferred from state transitions)

tetris.py ‚Äî Environment Logic
Implements a custom Tetris environment for training and testing.
Important Components:
    pieces: All 7 tetromino shapes.
    reset(): Starts a new game, randomizes the next piece.
    rotate(): Rotates a tetromino (used to test rotations).
    get_next_states(): Generates all possible next states for all valid actions (rotation + position).
    get_state_properties(): Encodes the board state into 4 features for the neural net:
        Lines cleared
        Number of holes
        Bumpiness
        Total height
    step(): Applies the chosen action and updates the board, score, and tetromino count. Returns reward and game status.
    render(): Displays the board using OpenCV.

train.py ‚Äî Training Loop
    This file trains the model using the DQN algorithm.
    Flow:
        Argument Parser:
            Configures parameters like width, height, learning rate, etc.
        Replay Memory:
            Stores experience tuples for batch training.
        Training Loop:
            while epoch < opt.num_epochs:
    ...
    At every step:
        Generates all next valid states.
        Predicts Q-values for each.
        Chooses action via epsilon-greedy strategy.
        Takes action, gets reward and next state.
        Stores experience in replay memory.
        Trains the model using MSE loss between:
            y = reward + gamma * max(Q(next_state))
    Saving Model:
        Saves the model if current score > max score achieved so far.

test.py ‚Äî Evaluation Script
    Loads the trained model and plays Tetris to evaluate its performance.
    Steps:
        Load model:
            model = torch.load(...)
            model.eval()
        Run game loop:
            For each frame, use model to predict best action.
            Step environment with that action.
            Render and optionally save to video.
Repeat multiple runs to get average score and lines cleared.

Absolutely! Let's walk through how training works in your Deep Q-Learning (DQN) implementation for Tetris step-by-step, in simple but detailed terms.

üí° Goal of Training
You're teaching an agent to play Tetris well by:

Observing the board state

Predicting good actions

Improving its decisions over time using reinforcement learning

This is done using the Deep Q-Learning algorithm with a neural network (Q-network) to estimate the Q-values.

üì¶ Main Components

Component	Role
Tetris environment	Where the game is played
DeepQNetwork	Learns to predict Q-values (how good an action is in a given state)
ReplayMemory (deque)	Stores past experiences for training
train.py	The training loop where learning happens
üîÅ Step-by-Step: Training Loop (from train.py)
1. Initialize Environment and Network
python
Copy
Edit
env = Tetris(...)
model = DeepQNetwork()
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(...)
Set up the game.

Initialize the neural network and optimizer.

2. Main Training Loop
python
Copy
Edit
while epoch < opt.num_epochs:
Runs for num_epochs (episodes).

Each epoch represents one Tetris game session.

3. Get Next States
python
Copy
Edit
next_steps = env.get_next_states()
For the current Tetris piece:

Try placing it in all possible positions and rotations.

For each option, calculate a "feature vector" (lines cleared, holes, bumpiness, height).

The agent will choose one of these to play next.

4. Epsilon-Greedy Action Selection
python
Copy
Edit
if random.random() < epsilon:
    action = random
else:
    action = best according to Q-network
Random action = exploration (try new things)

Best predicted action = exploitation (use what it has learned)

Epsilon (Œµ) gradually decreases to favor exploitation over time.

5. Play Action in Environment
python
Copy
Edit
reward, done = env.step(action)
Execute the chosen move.

Receive a reward (e.g., +1 for move, +bonus for lines cleared)

done becomes True if the game ends or max score is reached.

6. Store Experience in Replay Buffer
python
Copy
Edit
replay_memory.append([state, reward, next_state, done])
This stores:

state: the game board features before the action

reward: how good the move was

next_state: new board state after the action

done: whether the game ended

üß† This memory is used to train the agent after the fact.

7. Train the Neural Network
python
Copy
Edit
batch = sample(replay_memory, batch_size)
...
loss = criterion(q_values, y_batch)
loss.backward()
optimizer.step()
a. Sample random batch from memory (experience replay)
Prevents the network from learning based on recent correlated steps.

Increases stability.

b. Predict current Q-values for each state
python
Copy
Edit
q_values = model(state_batch)
c. Compute target Q-values (reward + Œ≥ * max Q(next state))
python
Copy
Edit
y_batch = reward + gamma * max(predicted future Q)
d. Compute loss (mean squared error)
Loss = how far off your predictions are from the true Q-values.

e. Backpropagate and update weights
Standard neural network training.

8. Save Best Model
python
Copy
Edit
if final_score > max_score:
    torch.save(model, ...)
Saves model checkpoint if it outperforms previous best.

üìà Output During Training
Score

Tetrominoes placed

Cleared lines

Saved to logs and tensorboard if needed
